description: An agent service to allow for the creation of new components. Built with
  love at ETHNYC 2023 by 8Baller, Asha, and Zarathustra. A number of novel firsts
  have been accomplished. First agent service to act as a CDN for a frontend. Implements
  additional http protocols, allowing for the handling of multiple http protocols
  within the same agent. This allows the seperation of the cdn, which is pulled from
  from ipfs by hash on agent startup.
